This project aims to bring the beloved game to a new generation of players, offering a fun and challenging experience that tests memory, concentration, and cognitive skills.

Players will be presented with a sequence of colored buttons that they must remember and repeat in the correct order. As the game progresses, the sequences become longer and more complex, providing an increasing level of difficulty and challenge.

"Challenge your memory and reflexes with Simon Says, the classic game of pattern repetition and concentration!"

So, please go to the code to check your memory power & concentration and have fun !
